# Constant Development

###### Welcome,
 Within this Organization you will seek various Resources, and Systems for your FiveM Server/Community. With this in mind, everything you see here is Open Source though, you aren't permitted to take set Code and use it towards a payout and such. If you are found doing so, you will be reported accordingly and further blacklisted from any Constant Development related Community.

### Discord Community

We highly recommnend that you join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/gSQbshCNv4). Why? Well, within this Community you'd be able to not only keep track of proper Updates but as well seek out our Paid Releases that we have, and are working on. With this in mind, you'd also be able to see content we're planning and further give suggestions on remarks you feel should be implemented. Yes, we do understand there is Pull Requests but that is more of something that you'd do if you're able to Code the Suggestion.
